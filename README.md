# Frontend-Project

Inspirational website: https://www.r-gol.com/ro

I wanted to do a copy of this clienside website using my knowledge in HTML, SCSS, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and JQUERY

I started with the header, which has the logo, searchBar, user, favorites and cart buttons

Only the user button has an event when click on it, to show a login page.
