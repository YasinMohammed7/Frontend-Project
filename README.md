Inspirational website: https://www.r-gol.com/ro

I wanted to do a copy of this clienside website using my knowledge in HTML, SCSS, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY and BOOTSTRAP 

I started with the header, which has the logo, searchBar, user, favorites and cart buttons

The user button has an event when click on it, to show a login page and the logo return to home page on click

The login page has a text "Inregistreaza-te?", which means to register if you don't have an account . When user click on it, it goes to the register page.It has a text "Aveti deja un cont?", when the user click on it, it goes back to the login page. When you create an account, on the webpage appears the login form and when you login, another page it will be displayed, the user page.

The navigation bar has 4 categories of products, which they have a dropdown menu made only in HTML and CSS with a transition on hover.

Both the header and nav have an event on scroll. When the user scroll down, they get a background color, unless they have background transparent

On the top of the home page, i've created a carousel with two buttons, next and previous with a javascript function.
